### My top projects

On my profile you will find some of my **personal projects** that I have developed in my free time, the majority are private but there are still some public ones.

These range from some where I am **trying to learn a new language/framework**, to a few where I showcase **what I can actually do**.

In summary, you can expect to find various projects related to:

ðŸ¥‡ **Full-Stack Web** Development ([React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript))

ðŸ¥ˆ **Git History Visualisation** ([OctoKit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/))

ðŸ¥‰ **Game Modding** (Various)
